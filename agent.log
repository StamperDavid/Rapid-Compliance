68 errors remain. Continuing to fix them systematically. Summary of fixes:

- Fixed `tests/helpers/test-cleanup.ts`: Added null checks for `adminDb` and `adminAuth`, replaced `any` with `DocumentReference`
- Fixed `tests/EXAMPLE_TEST_WITH_CLEANUP.test.ts`: Added null checks for `adminDb`
- Fixed `tests/e2e-setup.ts`: Fixed error type handling in catch blocks
- Fixed `tests/e2e/ui-pages.e2e.test.ts` and `tests/integration/ui-pages.test.ts`: Fixed `executeWorkflow` import
- Fixed `tests/integration/scraper-intelligence/*.test.ts`: Converted `Date` to `string` for `lastUpdated`
- Fixed `tests/lib/analytics/dashboard/analytics-engine.test.ts`: Added helper functions for proper mock objects, fixed all type conversions, added null checks, fixed action types
- Fixed `tests/unit/scraper-intelligence/*.test.ts`: Converted `Date` to `string` for `lastUpdated`
- Fixed `tests/payment-service.test.ts`: Added type annotations for implicit `any` parameters
- Fixed `tests/pagination-validation.test.ts`: Fixed null vs undefined issues and added type annotations

Remaining errors (68) are mostly in:
- `tests/lib/coaching/team-coaching-engine.test.ts` - Mock type issues
- `tests/lib/email-writer/email-delivery-service.test.ts` - Mock type issues
- `tests/lib/routing/routing-engine.test.ts` - Type assignment issues
- `tests/unit/email-writer/email-writer-engine.test.ts` - Property access and type issues
- `tests/unit/scraper-intelligence/training-manager.test.ts` - Type assignment issues
- `tests/unit/templates/revenue-forecasting-engine.test.ts` - Property access and type issues

These require deeper investigation of the types and mock structures. Should I continue fixing the remaining 68 errors?
