## **Video 2: Ensemble Mode Explained (2 minutes)**

### **Script:**

**[0:20-0:50] The Problem**
> "Most platforms use a single AI model - maybe GPT-4, maybe Claude. But here's the issue: different models are better at different things. GPT-4 is great at reasoning, Claude excels at creativity, Gemini is lightning fast. So which should you use? The answer: ALL OF THEM."

**[0:50-1:30] How Ensemble Works**
> "With Ensemble mode, we query 3 to 5 models in parallel. Each responds to your customer's question. Then, our advanced scoring system rates each response on coherence, relevance, specificity, and confidence. The highest-scoring answer wins and goes to your customer. All of this happens in under 2 seconds."

**[1:30-1:50] The Results**
> "The result? You always get the best possible answer. Not just good - the BEST. Our ensemble mode delivers 90 to 95% quality compared to the industry standard of 70 to 90%. That's the difference between a satisfied customer and a converted customer."

**[1:50-2:00] Conclusion**
> "No competitor has this. It's your secret weapon. Enable it in your AI agent settings and watch your conversion rates soar. Thanks for watching!"
