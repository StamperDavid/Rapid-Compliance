## **Video 2: Golden Master System Explained (2 minutes)**

### **Script:**

**[0:00-0:20] Intro**
> "What makes our AI different from competitors? Our Golden Master system. Let me show you what that means and why it matters."

**[0:20-0:50] The Problem**
> "Most AI chatbots forget everything between sessions. When a customer returns, they have to repeat their needs, their budget, their timeline - everything. It's frustrating and kills conversions."

**[0:50-1:30] How Golden Master Works**
> "With our Golden Master system, you train an AI agent specifically for your business. This becomes your 'Golden Master' - a versioned configuration you can deploy to production. Then, every customer gets a persistent memory. When they return, the agent remembers their previous conversations, preferences, and history. It's like having a sales rep who never forgets."

**[1:30-1:50] The Results**
> "The result? Customers feel recognized and valued. No repeating themselves. Your conversion rates improve because relationships persist across sessions. That's the difference between a one-time visitor and a loyal customer."

**[1:50-2:00] Conclusion**
> "Ready to give your customers a personalized AI experience? Train your Golden Master in the Training Center. It's that simple. Thanks for watching!"

**[1:00-2:30] Creating a Welcome Workflow**
