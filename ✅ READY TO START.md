1. **Firebase** (30 min):
   - Go to console.firebase.google.com
   - Create project
   - Copy 6 config values to .env.local
   - Restart server

2. **OpenRouter** (10 min):
   - Go to openrouter.ai
   - Sign up
   - Get API key
   - Add to app

3. **SendGrid** (30 min):
   - Go to sendgrid.com
   - Sign up
   - Verify email (REQUIRED!)
   - Get API key
   - Add to app

**Total time: ~70 minutes = App goes from 0% to actually working**

## 📁 Files You'll Use Today

**Guides:**
- `🚀 DAY 1 CHECKLIST.md` ← Your checklist
- `DAY_1_PROGRESS.md` ← Detailed steps
- `COMPLETION_PLAN.md` ← Full 4-week plan

**Configuration:**
- `.env.local` ← Add Firebase config here
- `firestore.rules` ← Already done (deploy later)

**Reference:**
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` ← Current status (35% complete)
- `FIREBASE_SETUP.md` ← Additional Firebase help if needed

---

## 🚨 IMPORTANT REMINDERS

1. **Don't skip SendGrid email verification** - Your emails won't send without it!
2. **Save API keys** - You can only see them once after creation
3. **Restart server after editing .env.local** - Changes won't apply otherwise
4. **Check browser console (F12)** - Error messages will help debug

---

## ⏱️ REALISTIC TIMELINE

- **Best case:** 90 minutes (if everything goes smoothly)
- **Realistic:** 2-3 hours (with normal hiccups)
- **Worst case:** 4-5 hours (if you hit issues)

**Don't rush it - getting it right matters more than speed.**
