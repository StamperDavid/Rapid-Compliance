## 🏗️ Architecture

Each template includes:

### 1. Scraping Strategy
```typescript
scrapingStrategy: {
  primarySource: 'website',
  secondarySources: ['linkedin-jobs', 'google-business', etc],
  frequency: 'per-lead' | 'weekly',
  timeoutMs: 30000,
  enableCaching: true,
  cacheTtlSeconds: 300-600
}
```

### 2. High-Value Signals
- **ID**: Unique identifier
- **Label**: Human-readable name
- **Description**: What it indicates
- **Keywords**: Phrases to detect
- **Regex Pattern** (optional): For complex matching
- **Priority**: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
- **Action**: increase-score, add-to-segment, trigger-workflow
- **Score Boost**: Points added when detected
- **Platform**: Where to look (website, linkedin-jobs, etc)

### 3. Fluff Patterns
- Remove noise: copyright, privacy policy, cookie banners
- Context-aware: header, footer, sidebar, body, all
- Regex-based for flexible matching

### 4. Scoring Rules
- Conditional logic combining multiple signals
- Priority-ordered evaluation
- Boost scores for powerful combinations

### 5. Custom Fields
- Industry-specific data extraction
- Type-safe (string, number, boolean, array, object, date)
- Default values for missing data
- Extraction hints for AI guidance

---

## 📈 Impact

### For Users:
- **Automated Lead Qualification:** Signals automatically score leads
- **Intelligent Data Extraction:** Custom fields capture industry-specific info
- **Noise-Free Content:** Fluff filters remove boilerplate
- **Smart Scoring:** Rules combine signals for nuanced qualification

- **Fast Processing:** <2s per scrape with caching
- **Scalable:** Service layer handles rate limiting and caching
- **Extensible:** Easy to add more templates using same pattern

---

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

Each template should be validated against:

1. **5 Real Industry Websites**
   - Test signal detection accuracy
   - Verify fluff filtering effectiveness
   - Validate scoring rule logic
   - Check custom field extraction

2. **Performance Benchmarks**
   - Scrape time <2 seconds
   - Signal detection >90% accuracy
   - Fluff reduction 20-40%
   - False positive rate <5%

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Empty websites
   - Heavy JavaScript sites
   - Multi-language content
   - Very large pages (>1MB)
