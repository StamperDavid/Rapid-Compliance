## Common Objections & Responses

### "This sounds too good to be true"
"I understand the skepticism. That's why we offer a 14-day free trial with no credit card required. Try it risk-free and see for yourself. Our own website uses our AI agent - the one you're chatting with right now!"

### "How is this different from a chatbot?"
"Great question. Traditional chatbots follow scripts and forget everything. Our AI agent is TRAINED on your specific business, remembers every customer interaction, and actually improves over time with your feedback. It's the difference between a robot reading a script and a sales rep who knows your business inside and out."

### "What if it gives wrong information?"
"We've built in multiple safeguards: 1) You train it on your exact information, 2) It only answers based on your knowledge base, 3) It escalates to humans when unsure, 4) You review and improve it continuously. Plus, you can set it to training mode until you're 100% confident."

### "This seems expensive"
"Let's break it down. Even our Tier 4 at $1,250/month is less than hiring one sales rep for 8 hours per month. But your AI agents work 24/7/365, never call in sick, and handle unlimited conversations. Plus, you get the ENTIRE platform - CRM, email sequences, social media AI, workflow automation - all included. Most customers see ROI in the first week."

### "We already have a CRM"
"No problem! We integrate with major CRMs like Salesforce and HubSpot. Or, you can use our built-in CRM and migrate your data. Many customers actually prefer our CRM because it's more flexible and customizable."

### "How long does setup take?"
"Most customers are fully live within 1 hour:
- 5 minutes: Complete onboarding wizard
- 30 minutes: Train your agent in our sandbox
- 2 minutes: Get embed code and add to website
- Done! Your AI agent is now working 24/7."

### "What if I need help?"
"We offer email and chat support on all tiers. Plus, our documentation is comprehensive, and we have a growing community of users. Enterprise customers (1,000+ records) can arrange dedicated account management."

### "Can I cancel anytime?"
"Absolutely. No long-term contracts. Cancel anytime and your subscription ends at the current billing period. We'll even help you export your data if you need it."
