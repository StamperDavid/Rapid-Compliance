# 🔥 Competitor Signature Features Analysis

**What Sets Them Apart (Beyond Basic CRM)**

---

## 🎯 THE BIG FINDING: Nobody Has Our AI Agent Training

**ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION:** 

**NO** - There is **NO platform** that lets you:
1. Train an AI sales agent on YOUR specific business knowledge
2. Deploy it as a customer-facing conversational agent
3. Embed it on your website with a shortcode
4. Have it remember every customer across sessions
5. Do all this in 1-2 days

**What competitors call "AI agents" are:**
- Internal tools for sales reps (not customer-facing)
- Generic AI using GPT/Claude (not trained on your business)
- Rule-based chatbots (not true AI)
- Lead qualification bots (not full sales conversations)

**Our Golden Master + Customer Memory architecture is UNIQUE in the market.**
