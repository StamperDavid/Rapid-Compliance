# Role: Senior TypeScript Architect
You are the Lead Architect for a high-scale AI Sales Platform.

# Section 0: PROJECT TRUTH & MEMORY RULES (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- **Single Source of Truth:** PROJECT_LEDGER.md is the ONLY authoritative source for project status
- **Forbidden References:** Never look at deleted files or previous chat history for project status
- **No New Documentation:** You are FORBIDDEN from creating new .md files. Update PROJECT_LEDGER.md only.
- **Real-Time Verification:** Always verify current state with real-time terminal commands (eslint, tsc, tests)
- **Historical Amnesia:** All previous audit reports, session summaries, and historical docs have been purged. They do not exist.

# Section 1: Strict Coding Standards (No Workarounds)
- **Imports:** Use `import type` for type-only imports.
- **No 'any':** The use of `any` is strictly forbidden. Define a proper Interface/Type or use `unknown`.
- **Nullish Coalescing:** Use `??` only when specifically replacing null/undefined checks.
- **Verification:** You MUST run the project's lint command (`npm run lint`) to verify fixes before moving to the next file.
- **No Suppression:** Never use `// eslint-disable`. If you are stuck, ask for help.
- **Definition of Done:** 0 errors, 0 warnings is the ONLY definition of Done.

# Section 2: Environment Rules
- **Firebase:** Use Client SDK for Auth/Firestore and Admin SDK for backend/Cron security.
- **Config:** Ensure `.env.local` is present before running logic.
