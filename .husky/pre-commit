# Atomic Quality Control: Only check staged files for ESLint
# TypeScript check runs on full project (required for type resolution)

echo "🔍 Running Atomic Quality Control..."

# Step 1: Lint only staged .ts/.tsx files (zero-tolerance)
echo "📝 ESLint: Checking staged files..."
npx lint-staged

# Step 2: TypeScript check (full project, but fast since it's incremental)
echo "🔷 TypeScript: Checking for build blockers..."
npx tsc --noEmit
