## 🏆 Where We WIN

### **1. AI & Customer Intelligence**
**Us:** 95/100  
**Them:** 20-40/100

**Our Advantages:**
- Persistent customer memory across all channels
- AI agent that learns and improves
- Predictive lead scoring (included)
- Deal health scoring (included)
- Next best action recommendations (included)
- Activity auto-logging from AI conversations

**Their Limitations:**
- AI costs extra ($50/user/month for Salesforce Einstein)
- No persistent memory (session-only)
- Generic chatbots (not trained on your business)
- Manual activity logging

**Impact:** This alone justifies choosing us over them for AI-forward teams

---

### **2. All-in-One Value**
**Us:** One platform for everything  
**Them:** Need 3-5 tools

**What We Include:**
- AI chatbot (would need Intercom: $74/mo)
- CRM (would need Pipedrive: $400/mo)
- Email sequences (included in CRM)
- Workflow automation (included)
- E-commerce (would need separate platform)
- Team collaboration (included)

**Total Replacement Value:** $500-800/month  
**Our Price:** $49-149/month  
**Savings:** 70-80%

---

### **3. Pricing Model**
**Us:** Org-based pricing ($49-149/month total)  
**Them:** Per-user pricing ($15-75/user/month)

**Example for 10-person team:**
- Pipedrive: $290-990/month
- HubSpot: $800-3,200/month
- Salesforce: $750-3,000/month
- **Us: $149/month** (one price for whole team)

**Advantage:** 80-95% cheaper for teams

---

## ⚠️ Where We're WEAK (Still)

---

### **2. Mobile App (Deal Breaker for Many)**
**Us:** 0/100  
**Them:** 90/100

**Impact:** 
- Sales reps in the field can't use us
- Can't log calls/meetings on the go
- No push notifications
- Lose 40-50% of potential deals

**Fix Timeline:** 4-6 weeks for custom report builder
